    "- Numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python that provides an abundance of useful features for operations with high performance and enhanced speed of execution due to vectorization of mathemetics otherwise performed on scalers.\n",

    "- The functionally of Pandas is built on top of NumPy and both libraries belong to the SciPy stack. Pandas allows more conveinent synax and interface handling dataframes.\n",

    "Note: Pandas is optimized with smaller dataset (100MB ~ 1GB), and developers typically experience insufficient local memory and long runtime trying to run the module with significantly larger dataset. One solution is to leverage cloud/ distributed computing or computing cluster for higher scalability and fault tolerance.\n",
