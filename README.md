Working repositary for all scripts developed for R&amp;D and staging online course material

One Dataset: Google Play Store Play, sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps

Jupyter Scripts that practice how to:
1. load local data file
2. display dataset specifications and sample
3. preprocess including changeing data format, sorting, filtering, droping columns and rows
4. process data including pivoting, writing and calling self-defined functions, overwriting or modifying content
5. Associating business objectives to quantified analytical methods
6. analysis with statistics techniques, including Normal and asymmetrical distribution hypothesis testing with assumed independence between variables: two-way two sample z test, RankSum test, ANOVA test
7. visualize dataset variable distribution using boxplot and scatter plot, plus trendline
8. develop linear and nonlinear regression equation and variability
